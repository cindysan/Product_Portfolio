							<h1 style="text-align:center">365 Day Design Challenge</h1>
                            <p>November 1, 2019 was the day I started my design journey. I didn’t know what I
                                was getting myself into, but it was all worthwhile. Here’s my story.</p>
                            <link rel = "stylesheet" href="main365.css">
                            <div id="bm_365day"></div>
                            <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bodymovin/5.6.8/lottie.min.js"></script>
                            <script src="index_365day.js"></script>


                            <div class="align-center">
                                <h2>Why?</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p>2 years ago I bought a tablet and started scribbling cute sticker designs on Adobe Photoshop as
                                a side hobby. After a year long hiatus from designing I was itching to get back into it.
                                During the winter of 2019 I met a product designer who completed a 365 day design challenge
                                which inspired me to do the same.</p>
                            <p>Coming into the challenge I knew it wouldn’t be easy, so I started the 100 Days with a focus
                                on vector illustrations. The original purpose for this design challenge was to improve my
                                design skills and become proficient in design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Sketch.
                            </p>

                            <div class="align-center">
                                <h2>Getting started: Tutorials</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p>I remember the first day I sat down and tried using the pen tool. It was a disaster.
                                I almost gave up within the first hour. Without any previous experience with vector designs
                                I started watching youtube tutorials and practiced for a few days. The very first tutorial I
                                worked through was creating vector plants on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTV2n7fT4fk&t=204s" target="_blank">youtube</a>.
                                This gave me foundation on cutting shapes,
                                aligning items and also getting more comfortable with the pen tool. Within a week the tutorials
                                helped me build the confidence that I needed to begin my 365 day journey.
                            </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/365_1.png" alt="" /></span>



                            <div class="align-center">
                                <h2>The beginning: Day 1 - Day 30</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p>The first few days my designs were related to the tools I've learned from tutorials and soon
                                after that I was able to start creating independently. I started posting my work on Instagram
                                and had a handful of my friends followed me through the fun. ⅓ into my design challenge I created
                                vector designs of random things or anything that I could think of. </p>
                            <p>Gradually building my audience, I set aside 1 to 3 hours a day solely for designing. I
                                felt the need to elevate my flat designs by introducing elements such as shading, masking
                                and 2D design. After the first 10 days, I familiarized myself with shortcut tools and started
                                producing designs more quickly.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/365_2.png" alt="" /></span>



                            <div class="align-center">
                                <h2>Challenging days: Day 30 - Day 75</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p>I have become more proficient with my skills and use of design tools by ⅔ into the challenge,
                                however this was during my exam period. I was on a 1 week hiatus to focus on my studies, which
                                was needed to relieve the cognitive load and allow my brain to rest. Although I felt discouraged
                                for missing 7 full days of design, I made it up by constructing expert-level vectors that require
                                more detail. This was only the halfway point of my challenge and I knew I would be running short on
                                original content, so I decided to focus on a theme where I can reuse similar colour palettes and make
                                my overall designs more cohesive. This method saved me a lot of time and allowed me to focus more on
                                the design content and style more intensely.
                            </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/365_3.png" alt="" /></span>


                            <div class="align-center">

                            <p>With both motivation and confidence, I can see that my overall design has improved immensely
                                since Day 1 of the design challenge. I explored social media and design platforms such as
                                Instagram, Dribble and Medium to see other forms of art that I could try my hand at designing.
                                I dabbled in creating neon vectors and also isometric designs, which was refreshing as if I was
                                learning how to design again.</p>

                            <p>Nope! I still have 200+ days to go. Please join me on my journey of continuing my 365 Days
                                of Design Challenge as I will continue into daily UI Designs and Motion Designs.</p>

                                <h2>Takeaways </h2>
                            </div>

                            <p>After successfully completing 100+ designs I feel fulfilled with accomplishments.
                                The late nights, and long hours of designing has taught me that determination and
                                consistency will improve your craft by ten-fold. Although I spent countless nights
                                catching up on creating content, it has paid off as I was given opportunities to create
                                commissioned logo work. Here’s a few things I’ve learned over the 365 Day Design Challenge.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Being productive &mdash;</span> Follow through with one design
                                and make sure you set pivotal goals for yourself. Whether it be trying new design tactics or
                                creating a simple vector by the end of the night. There were days where I felt sluggish and
                                my designs didn’t feel right, but posting  it was worthwhile because I knew I could reflect
                                on my progress.
                            </p>

                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Engaging in the design community &mdash;</span> Create an
                                account for your designs. Whether it’s Medium, Dribble, Instagram or even Facebook, sharing
                                your work with other designers in an inclusive community is rewarding. I’ve received many
                                compliments and supportive feedback from friends and designers on Instagram.
                            </p>

                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Building confidence &mdash;</span> It’s okay if you miss a day.
                                Don’t be discouraged, everyone needs a mental break sometimes and spending hours on end designing
                                can be frustrating. Making original content isn’t always easy, so I decided to create my designs
                                in themes where the colour selections are similar and make the overall piece cohesive and easier
                                for me to complete.

                            </p>



                            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not everything you make will look nice &mdash;</span>It’s
                                part of the journey, just post it. There’s good days and there are bad days. The best way to
                                improve your skills and use of design tools are from practice and dedication. Don’t let one design stop you from pushing forward.

                            </p>
