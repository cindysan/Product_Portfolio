            <h2 style="text-align:center">Background</h2>
            <p>Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, TD Canada Trust has taken the initiative to introduce a digital
                managing queue platform mid May of 2020. As many businesses and customers  are scrambling to
                return to normal, the safety of staff and customers are in high priority. The digital queue
                requires no lineup, promoting strong social distancing measures and also provides opportunities for
                financial institutions to dip into new horizons with digital banking. Thus, the importance of screening customer
                needs prior to them entering the branch can prevent long lineups. This serves as an essential purpose in saving time
                and increasing overall productivity between customers and TD employees. </p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Why Redesign?</h2>
            <p>As a designer and a long-term employee/customer of TD Canada trust, I encountered frustrations when using
                the Mobile Check In system. So I challenged myself to redesign TD’s interface to optimize a two-sided
                business model within 2 weeks. Starting the journey with optimizing customer experience. View my redesign
                of <a href="404.html"target="_blank">LAVI</a> &mdash; TD employee interface system. </p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Research and Insight</h2>
            <p>Problems with the TD Mobile Check In service have been expressed by both TD clients and TD staff.
                I have completed over 20+ contextual inquiries whilst helping and observing clients operating the
                mobile service firsthand. I have also followed up with employees and clients with survey questionnaires.</p>

            <div class="font_italic">
                <div class="font_green">
                    <div class="font_space">
                    <p>“I make daily corporate cheque deposits and I waste time coming down and waiting in queue"</p>
                        <p>“Not a fan, it looks outdated and slow"</p>
                        <p>“My number in line says I'm 12th and then I'm ready to be helped... I don't have enough time to make my way over"</p>
                        <p>“It feels faster because I just grab a coffee and go through my emails"</p>
                        <p>“I went shopping today and my position in line was cancelled because I was 5 minutes late..."</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="font_bold"><p>Following these responses, I made these insights:</p> </div>

            <div class="font_space">
                <p>1. Customers get frustrated when they are asked to fill out the inputs to be added
                    into the queue. The option such as “Tell us more” is redundant and should be a quick and easy screening process.
                <p>2. Text notifications were seen as clutter and spam with repetitive messages that displayed inconsistent queue times. This causes panic and urgency in clients</p>
                <p>3. Customers new to the mobile check in service found it difficult or frstrating to use. However,
                    regular clients and employees who regularly use the app compensated/adjusted to make the app useful to them.</p>
                <p>4. Users found it confusing when they see their queue number displayed on the website and also
                    received by text because the texts were more accurate compared to the “Live queue.”</p>
                <p>5. Users find the navigation difficult as they didn’t know a requeue option was available. Meaning
                    that many have lost their place in line because they were unaware that they could notify tellers that
                    they were going to be late.</p>

                        <p>How can I help improve the <span style="font-weight: bold;">customer experience</span> through
                            an<span style="font-weight: bold;"> efficient</span> queuing system?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>


            <p>From the contextual inquiries and questionnaires I have conducted, it has shown a pattern of clients being
                frustrated with the inconsistency of the queue system. It shows that a handful users were not able to navigate
                through the digital application without running into confusion and having to ask employees for guidance.
                This is shown as counterproductive as the check in for the mobile queuing system should be a “no brainer.”
                Another issue that I noticed were that the majority of clients who missed their spot in line were due to the
                fact that they were notified to come into the branch at the last minute.
            </p>

            <p>I introduced a natural and easy navigation workflow where users are able to complete everything they need
                within one screen. The virtual queue can be accessed through several portals such as TD app,
                QR code and also online browsers, improving productivity between teller-client interactions.
                Text clutter has been reduced as it can be seen as “spam” because clients were receiving a fluctuant amount
                of texts. This was done by creating texts that hold sufficient information regarding the lineup without spamming clients.</p>

            <p>I studied the design systems of a few queue operations that are offered for retail services while creating
                my solution. I decided to create a simple “no brainer” workflow to keep things natural and efficient
                inspired by the Take-A-Number system where the waiting room is a virtual one.</p>

            <p>So, for my solution I have decided to section things that can be improved such as the visual design, user flow,
                and also revamping text messages whilst keeping brand identity in mind.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This 2 week project was extremely rewarding for me as a designer. This redesign aims to improve an essential
                tool used by clients and tellers in public sectors. It challenged me to set aside my own assumptions and frustrations
                with the system and proactively seek feedback. Here’s a few things I’ve learned over the short-term case study.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don’t be afraid to create a product redesign &mdash;</span> The best time to create a product redesign was yesterday.
                If you know what usability issues there are and feel that you can improve it, do it. The experience of doing a
                redesign has improved my user research and understanding of making sure that my design doesn’t just look “pretty”
                but serves a purpose to improve the lifestyle and wellbeing of others.
            </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Empathize with users &mdash;</span> This project forced me to improve my rendering skills, but more importantly
                it taught me about designing for the user. Having a deeper understanding of your users can enhance problem-solving approaches.
            </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Importance of micro-interactions &mdash;</span> I conducted 10 user interviews, but the most insight I received were
                from contextual inquiries. I was able to conduct over 20+ contextual inquiries followed up with questions for clients that
                helped me understand their frustrations and successes with the Mobile Check In system. The insight I received was translated
                to optimize the user experience for clients.
            </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create a deadline for redesigns &mdash;</span> Creating a redesign can be tedious and make you feel burnt out
                at times. During the first few days of this case study, I was overwhelmed by the amount of work I had to put in and almost
                completely stopped. However, I created a schedule of what I could accomplish in a day without overloading my plate. I found that
                it made me efficient as I felt accomplished every step of the way.
            </p>
